    "# Section 1: Understand Structure of Matplotlib Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start plotting, let's first understand the general structure of a block of Matplotlib code\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we always start by initializing our figure. The figure is sort of the \"canvas\" that our plot(s) will be drawn on. Typically the only parameters we pass into the figure is the `figsize`, which is a tuple, `(x, y)` where `x` is the width and `y` is the height (both in inches)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "f = plt.figure(figsize=(x, y))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we move to the actual drawing of our plot. This will vary depending on what type of plot we are plotting. \n",
    "```\n",
    "some plot\n",
    "```\n",
    "After drawing, we need to add a few more things to make our plot more interpretable. While these may seem tedious, these are just best practices when it comes to creating plots for others to view. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's important to set our axis labels and title. We can do this by calling the `xlabel`, `ylabel` and `title` functions. \n",
    "```\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"X units\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Y units\")\n",
    "plt.title(\"Plot of Y vs. X\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lastly, it's important to actually show our plot. We can accomplish this by using the `.show()` function.\n",
    "```\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "And there's our plot! We'll get to using these when we learn some plots."

    "# Types of Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different plots, however, each plot serves a different purpose. Certain plots lend themselves more to certain datatypes (categorical, numerical). Different plots also aim to convey different insights (frequency, proportion, correlation, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is important to understand the code for creating each plot, prioritize having a *conceptual* understanding of each plot first. We can always find the code through online documentation, but understanding when and where to use certain plots may not always be as intuitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get into it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram is used to analyze the distribution of a single variable. Each bin represents a \"category\" of the data, and the y-value of the bin represents the number of occurrences, or frequency of that category. It's useful to do a quick eye-check for any outliers, mean/median, skewness, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a histogram, simply access the column of the variable you want to analyze, and call `.hist()`. A typical parameter for the histogram is the `bins`, and this just specifies the number of bins we want in our plot. This value will vary depending on your data and use case. \n",
    "```\n",
    "df[\"columnName\"].hist(bins=X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bar Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart is typically used to visualize some categorical (x-axis) variable. While it is similar to the histogram, the bar chart can graph more than just frequency on its y-axis. Let's say you own a grocery store, and you want the total revenues for different categories of foods (fruits, vegetables, meats). A bar chart would be perfect, as the food categories would be different bars on our x-axis, and the heights (y-values) of those bars would be the total revenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a bar chart, simply use the `.bar()` function. As parameters...\n",
    "- `x` refers to the x-axis variable you would like\n",
    "- `height` refers to the y-axis variable\n",
    "- `color` refers to the color of your bars\n",

    "**Note** Use line plots when each x-value has **one** y-value associated with it. For example, simply plotting `Age` versus `RoomService` won't work since there may be multiple values for `RoomService` associated with certain `Ages`. Plotting the average or total `RoomService` for each age works, since for any given age, there can only be one average or total `RoomService` value. \n",

    "The scatter plot is similar to the line plot in that we use it to show the relationship between two numerical variables.

Thus, this makes scatter plots more commmonly used and convenient when finding relationships between numerical variables. \n",
